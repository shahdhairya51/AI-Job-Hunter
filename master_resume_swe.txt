WORK EXPERIENCE
Graduate Instructional Assistant (ML I & ML II) | George Washington University Jan 2025 – May 2025
- Demonstrated ownership and deep technical knowledge by mentoring 100+ graduate students in implementing core machine learning algorithms (supervised learning, neural networks, ensemble methods) and writing production-quality Python code.
- Delivered results for student projects by leading debugging and optimization sessions focused on improving model performance, mitigating overfitting, and ensuring efficient data pipeline design with NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Software Development Engineer | Empyron Solutions Sep 2023 – July 2024
- Demonstrated customer obsession and ownership by leading end-to-end resolution of critical deployment downtime for 7,000+ users. Architected and deployed event-driven microservices on AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB), ensuring zero downtime during peak traffic and restoring customer trust.
- Improved customer experience by eliminating latency bottlenecks. Optimized state management and implemented Redis caching with intelligent TTL policies, reducing average API response time by 27% for a faster, more responsive application.
- Architected scalable solutions by designing GraphQL APIs and RESTful services, containerizing applications with Docker, and orchestrating with Kubernetes for auto-scaling, enabling faster feature delivery in Agile sprints.

Full Stack Developer | Totem Interactive Jan 2023 – Aug 2023
- Delivered results by building and scaling a distributed web platform using Angular, Java (Spring Boot), and PostgreSQL, supporting seamless scaling for 5,000+ active users and improving system performance by 14%.
- Drove operational excellence by integrating Grafana/Prometheus dashboards for real-time production monitoring. This enhanced visibility reduced Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) by 25% during high-traffic incidents, ensuring high availability.
- Improved code quality and velocity by automating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

Frontend Developer Intern | University of Texas at Dallas Aug 2022 – Nov 2022
- Developed full-stack ride-sharing app (React/Node.js/Socket.io) with real-time tracking for 250+ users.
- Integrated Google Maps API & Firebase Auth, reducing average wait time by 20%.

PROJECTS
Geospatial Early Impact Assessment Framework for UNICEF | Winner at United Nations Tech over Hackathon June 2025
- Engineered a data pipeline processing 3M+ points, enabling real-time disaster assessment for UN officials using LLMs.
- Optimized PostgreSQL/PostGIS with advanced indexing, cutting query latency by 76% (12s to 2.8s) for rapid decision-making.
- Owned full-stack development of a React.js dashboard for visualizing child vulnerability across 5 hazard types.

WellNest | ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, OpenAI, Github API | Github | Winner at George Hacks 2025 March 2025
- Leveraged OpenAI API to automate metadata generation for 100+ GitHub repos, solving open-source discoverability.
- Applied ML (LLM parser) to Invent and Simplify, slashing manual documentation time from 30 min to 3 min.
- Demonstrated end-to-end ownership by integrating GitHub REST API to automate PR submission.
