WORK EXPERIENCE
AI Engineer | Empyron Solutions Sep 2023 – July 2024
- Built RAG-based intelligent search using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI embeddings; reduced query resolution time from 15
minutes to under 2 minutes for 7,000+ users.
- Fine-tuned open-source LLMs using LoRA and PEFT for domain-specific generation; achieved 35% relevance improvement
while cutting inference costs by 40%.
- Architected NLP pipelines using Hugging Face Transformers and SpaCy for document processing; extracted structured data
from 10,000+ records with 92% NER accuracy.
- Deployed containerized ML services on AWS (EC2, SageMaker) with Docker/Kubernetes; implemented Redis caching
reducing inference latency from 140ms to 60ms.
Machine Learning Engineer| Totem Interactive Jan 2023 – Aug 2023
- Developed predictive ML pipeline using scikit-learn and XGBoost for user behavior forecasting; improved prediction accuracy
by 25% for 5,000+ active users.
- Built real-time anomaly detection using PyTorch autoencoders; reduced false positives by 30% with MLflow experiment
tracking and Prometheus monitoring.
- Automated feature engineering pipelines with Spark and Airflow processing 500K+ daily events; implemented CI/CD for ML
models reducing release cycles from 2 weeks to 3 days.
PROJECTS
AI-Powered Disaster Risk Assessment Engine | Winner at United Nations Tech over Hackathon June 2025
- Built ML-based risk prediction system analyzing 5 hazard types across 3M+ geospatial data points; implemented ensemble
models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) achieving 89% accuracy in child vulnerability prediction.
- Engineered feature extraction pipeline using GeoPandas and PostGIS for spatial feature engineering; optimized inference from
12s to 2.8s using vectorized operations and spatial indexing.
- Developed RAG-powered query interface using LangChain and OpenAI for natural language disaster insights; enabled UN
officials to query risk data conversationally.
